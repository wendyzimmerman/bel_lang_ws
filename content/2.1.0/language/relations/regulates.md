Long form: regulates
Short form: reg

For terms A and B, `A regulates B` or `A reg B` indicate that A is reported to have an effect on B, but information is missing about whether A increases B or A decreases B. This relationship provides more information than the association relationship, because the upstream entity (source term) and downstream entity (target term) can be assigned.
