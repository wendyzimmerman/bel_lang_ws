Long form: decreases
Short form: -|

For terms A and B, `A decreases B` or `A -| B` indicate that increases in A have been observed to cause decreases in B.

`A decreases B` also represents cases where decreases in A have been observed to cause increases in B, for example, in recording the results of gene deletion or other inhibition experiments.

A is a BEL Term and B is either a BEL Term or a BEL Statement.

The `decreases` relationship does not indicate that the changes in A are either necessary for changes in B, nor does it indicate that changes in A are sufficient to cause changes in B.
