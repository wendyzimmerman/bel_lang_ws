Long form: positiveCorrelation
Short form: pos

For terms A and B, `A positiveCorrelation B` or `A pos B` indicates that changes in A and B have been observed to be positively correlated. The order of the subject and object does not affect the interpretation of the statement, thus `B positiveCorrelation A` is equivalent to `A positiveCorrelation B`.
