Long form: association
Short form: --

For terms A and B, `A association B` or `A -- B` indicates that A and B are associated in an unspecified manner. This relationship is used when not enough information about the association is available to describe it using more specific relationships, like `increases` or `positiveCorrelation`. The order of the subject and object does not affect the interpretation of the statement, thus `B -- A` is equivalent to `A -- B`.
