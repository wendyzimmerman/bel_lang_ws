Long form: hasComponent
Short form: hasComponent

For complex abundance term A and abundance term B, `A hasComponent B` designates B as a component of A, that complexes that are instances of A have instances of B as possible components. Note that, the stoichiometry of A is not described, nor is it stated that B is a required component.

The use of `hasComponent` relationships is complementary to the use of functionally composed complexes and is intended to enable the assignment of components to complexes designated by names in external vocabularies. The assignment of components can potentially enable the reconciliation of equivalent complexes at knowledge assembly time.
